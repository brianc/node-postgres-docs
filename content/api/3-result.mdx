The `pg.Result` shape is returned for every successful query.

## properties

### `result.rows: Array<any>`

Every result will have a rows array. If no rows are returned the array will be empty. Otherwise the array will contain one item for each row returned from the query. By default node-postgres creates a map from the name to value of each column, giving you a json-like object back for each row.

### `result.fields: Array<FieldInfo>`

Every result will have a fields array. This array contains the `name` and `dataTypeId` of each field in the result. These fields are ordered in the same order as the columns if you are using `arrayMode` for the query:

```js
const { Pool } = require('pg')

const pool = new Pool()

const client = await pool.connect()
const result = await client.query({
  rowMode: 'array',
  text: 'SELECT 1 as one, 2 as two;',
})
console.log(result.fields[0].name) // one
console.log(result.fields[1].name) // two
console.log(result.rows) // [ [ 1, 2 ] ]
await client.end()
```

### `result.rowCount: int`

The number of rows processed by the last command. 

_note: this does not reflect the number of rows __returned__ from a query.  e.g. an update statement could update many rows (so high `result.rowCount` value) but `result.rows.length` would be zero.  To check for an empty query reponse on a `SELECT` query use `result.rows.length === 0`_.

### `result.command: string`

The command type last executed: `INSERT` `UPDATE` `CREATE` `SELECT` etc.
