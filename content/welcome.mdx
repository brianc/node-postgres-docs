node-postgres is a collection of node.js modules for interfacing with your PostgreSQL database. It has support for callbacks, promises, async/await, connection pooling, prepared statements, cursors, streaming results, C/C++ bindings, rich type parsing, and more! Just like PostgreSQL itself there are a lot of features: this documentation aims to get you up and running quickly and in the right direction. It also tries to provide guides for more advanced & edge-case topics allowing you to tap into the full power of PostgreSQL from node.js.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install pg
```

## Supporters

node-postgres continued development and support is made possible by the many [supporters](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/blob/master/SPONSORS.md) with a special thanks to our featured supporter:

## Getting started

This is the simplest possible way to connect, query, and disconnect with async/await:

```js
const { Client } = require('pg')
const client = new Client()

await client.connect()

const res = await client.query('SELECT $1::text as message', ['Hello world!'])
console.log(res.rows[0].message) // Hello world!
await client.end()
```

And here's the same thing with callbacks:

```js
const { Client } = require('pg')
const client = new Client()

client.connect()

client.query('SELECT $1::text as message', ['Hello world!'], (err, res) => {
  console.log(err ? err.stack : res.rows[0].message) // Hello World!
  client.end()
})
```

Our real-world apps are almost always more complicated than that, and I urge you to read on!
